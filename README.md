# Python Basics Examples

This repository contains several Python scripts demonstrating various basic concepts and operations in Python.

## Files and Their Contents

### ex1.py
- Demonstrates conditional statements (if-elif) and boolean logic
- Takes user input for weather conditions and umbrella possession
- Outputs recommendations based on the input

### ex2.py
- Illustrates basic list operations
- Shows how to access, modify, and remove elements from a list

### ex3.py
- Demonstrates list slicing and iteration
- Includes an example of list comprehension

### ex4.py
- Showcases various list methods (append, insert, remove)
- Demonstrates the use of built-in functions like len(), max(), and min()

### ex5.py
- Covers string operations and methods
- Includes examples of string concatenation, slicing, and built-in methods

### ex6.py
- Demonstrates string formatting techniques
- Shows how to find substrings and use string methods
- Includes an example of user input and string manipulation

### ex7.py

- Simple algorithmic thinking

### ex8.py
- Demonstrates dictionary operations using two use cases:
  1. Student Registration System
  2. Student Course Registration System

Covers:
- Creating and manipulating dictionaries
- Iterating over keys, values, and items
- Updating, checking, and deleting dictionary elements
- Nested dictionaries

### ex9.py
- Multiple programs demonstrating loop-based data analysis:
  1. Sprint time tracker
  2. Weekly ratings analyzer
  3. Patient temperature monitor
  4. Machine learning accuracy trend
  5. Autonomous vehicle speed control
  6. Medication adherence tracking

Covers:
- For loops and conditional statements
